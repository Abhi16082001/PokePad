ðŸ“˜PokePad â€“ A Notepad Clone with a PokÃ©mon Twist
This project was a small assignment from my Full Stack .NET course, given once I became comfortable with GUI development in C#. The objective was to create a basic Notepad clone, but I wanted to add a personal touch as a long-time PokÃ©mon fan.

Initially, I planned to give it a strong PokÃ©mon theme, but due to time constraints and the fast pace of the course syllabus, I limited the customization to just the application icon and name. I named it "PokePad" as a tribute, even though it doesnâ€™t include extensive PokÃ©mon references beyond that.

I focused on replicating core Notepad functionality while keeping things simple and efficient. This project is not overly complex but reflects my growing understanding of Windows Forms and GUI concepts in C#.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

1. Basic file operations (New, Open, Save, Save As, Print, Print Preview, Page Setup)
2. Text editing functionalities (Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Find/Replace One and All, Select All)
3. Word wrap toggle
4. Font and color customization (For Editor, Menu Bar, Status Bar)
5. Status bar toggle
6. PokÃ©mon-themed icon and title
7. Various Editor Theme Options

This was a fun and valuable exercise, and I hope you enjoy checking it out!
Note: I have used Form2 for getting the input for Find and Replace options as at that time I wasn't aware of InputBox but later I thought InputBox would be very typical for these type of scenarios and also due to time constraints, I didn't change that.
